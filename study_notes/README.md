## Brief Summary of Hedge Funds
Hedge Funds, broadly speaking, are investment funds that have less regulation and more flexibility relative to other, “classic” investment funds, such as mutual funds (more on this distinction is written below). A Hedge Fund will have an investment manager, and will typically be open to a limited range of investors who pay a performance fee to the fund’s manager on profits earned by the fund.  Each Hedge Fund has its own investment philosophy that determines the type of investments and strategies it employs.

In general, the Hedge Fund community undertakes a much wider range of investment and trading activities than do traditional investment funds. Hedge Funds can employ high-risk or exotic trading, such as investing with borrowed money or selling securities for short sale, in hopes of realizing large capital gains. Additionally Hedge Funds invest in a broader range of assets, including long and short positions in Equities, Fixed Income, Foreign Exchange, Commodities and illiquid hard assets, such as Real Estate.

The first hedge funds were thought to have existed prior to the Great Depression in the 1920s, though they did not gain in popularity until the 1980s, with funds managed by legendary investors including Julian Robertson, Michael Steinhardt and George Soros.   Soros gained widespread notoriety in 1992 when his Quantum Investment Fund correctly bet against the Bank of England by predicting that the pound would be devalued, having been pushed into the European Rate Mechanism at too high a rate.   Soros’ bet paid off to the tune of $1 billion, and set the stage for future hedge fund entrants, who speculated on markets based on fundamental and quantitative factors.

### Hedge Funds: How Do They Differ from Mutual Funds?
Similar to Hedge Funds, mutual funds are pools of investment capital. However, there are many differences between the two, including the following:

- Mutual funds are regulated by the SEC; Hedge Funds are not.
- Hedge Fund investors must be accredited (meaning they have a certain amount of liquid assets).
- Many mutual fund strategies are “long-only,” suggesting that individual securities cannot be sold short (although increasingly, long-only managers are able to sell short indices via futures and options).
- Mutual funds generally do not have a performance fee, generally only charging a management fee.

### Hedge Fund Revenue Structure
Hedge funds charge both a management fee and a performance fee. While this varies by fund, typical management fees consist of 1-2% of assets under management and performance or incentive fees of approximately 20% taken from gross profits.  The performance fee is a key defining characteristic of a hedge fund, motivating the hedge fund manager to generate superior returns by aligning his interests with those of the investors. In contrast, mutual funds and long-only managers usually charge only a management fee.

### Hedge Fund Industry Today
Total investor capital inflow allocated to hedge funds in Q1 2012 exceeded $16 billion, with the number of funds having increased for 9 consecutive quarters to reach 7,477 total funds as of Q3 2011.  Asset growth has risen faster than growth in the number of new funds, implying investor preference for allocation to the industry’s largest firms.  As of Q4 2011, assets under management across all hedge fund strategies was estimated at $1.641 trillion (with an additional $315 billion residing with managed futures/CTA accounts), reflecting a drop of more than $200 billion from Q2 2011.

## What is a Quantitative Hedge Fund?
A Quantitative Hedge Fund is any Hedge Fund that relies upon algorithmic or systematic strategies for implementing its trading decisions. Quant trading strategies may focus on any asset class (equities, derivatives, fixed income, foreign exchange, commodities, etc.), with trades that are based on systematic strategies, rather than discretionary decisions.  In other words, at least to some degree Quantitative Hedge Funds employ “automatic” trading rules rather than ones that employees at the fund identify and evaluate. Of course, these two strategies can be mixed, but nearly all Hedge Funds are either primarily a Quant Hedge Fund or primarily a non-Quant Hedge Fund.

For the rest of this discussion, we will refer to non-Quant Hedge Funds as “Fundamental Hedge Funds”—in other words, funds whose investment style is largely or entirely driven by fundamental research that attempts to value securities in the marketplace and identify “undervalued” and “overvalued” assets.

Both Fundamental and Quantitative Hedge Funds may use fundamental information, such as economic data, accounting/financial data as well as governmental, demographic and industry measures of supply and demand.   However, the primary difference is that Quantitative Analysts will look to use this data in a systematic, automated way. Often, the Quantitative Analyst will use tens if not hundreds of different types of data to predict a single output (rules about which assets to buy and sell); these analyses will then be used to identify attractive long and short positions. Much of this data will take the form of time-series information (for example, Ten-Year Treasury yield over time), or cross-sectional information (for example, different Price/Earnings ratios for companies in a given industry).  Quantitative Analysts will not perform detailed, “bottom-up”  fundamental analysis of stocks or other individual securities; rather they may try to get a sense of the relative attractiveness of dozens or hundreds of different assets simultaneously.

Similarly, Quant Hedge Funds will rarely employ macro-driven analysis like those found at a Global Macro Hedge Fund, such as monetary policy and its impact on bond markets or currency exchange rates, or assessments of political stability or labor relations in a given market. For Quant Analysts, this data is most likely too subjective, unless it can somehow be rigorously quantified.

In short:  all Hedge Fund managers may analyze fundamental factors, but Quantitative Hedge Funds will not use any qualitative or subjective information that cannot be aggregated systematically and statistically analyzed.  A Quantitative Hedge Fund will base trading decisions on a mathematical model (which may be populated in part by fundamental factors), but there is generally little human judgment with respect to trading decisions outside of this model. In other words, Quantitative Analysts try to develop intelligent models that predict which trades to make.

### Quantitative Trading Models
Quantitative Hedge Funds develop complex mathematical models to try to predict investment opportunities—typically in the form of predictions about which assets are projected to have high returns (for long investments) or low/negative returns (for short investments). As computing power has blossomed over the past couple of decades, so has the use of sophisticated modeling techniques, such as optimization, prediction modeling, neural networks and other forms of machine-learning algorithms (where trading strategies evolve over time by "learning" from past data).

### Factor-Based Modeling
One common, classic Quant Hedge Fund modeling approach is called Factor-Based Modeling. In this data, predictor (or "independent") variables, such as Price/Earnings ratio, or inflation rates, or the change in unemployment rates, are used to attempt to predict the value of another variable of interest ("dependent" variables), such as the predicted change in the price of a stock.

Factor models may base trading decisions on a pre-determined set of factors (such as returns on the S&P 500, the U.S. dollar index, a corporate bond index, a commodity index such as the CRB, and a measure of changes in corporate bond spreads and the VIX) or a set of factors related mathematically (but with no explicit specification) such as those gleaned through Principal Component Analysis (PCA).

### Mathematical Representation
A generalized one-factor model attempting to predict returns R using factor F would take the following form:

$$
R_{it} = \alpha + \beta_i\lambda + \beta_iF_t + \sigma_i\varepsilon_{it}
$$

where $$R_{it}$$, $$i = 1, \ldots, N$$ and $$t = 1, \ldots, T$$, is the excess (over the risk-free rate) return of asset $$i$$ at time $$t$$, and $$F_t$$ is the factor under consideration with zero mean and variance $$\sigma^2_F$$.

### Model Components and Variables
Factor models may incorporate fundamental information, including determinants of "value" versus "growth" stocks such as:
* Cash flow multiples
* Sales to price ratios
* P/E to earnings growth figures
* Dividend payout ratios
* Return on equity

For fixed income models, factors tend to be related to:
* Macroeconomic variables (industrial production, employment growth, or inflation relative to trend)
* Financial metrics (interest coverage ratios or Debt/EBITDA)

Tests may be run on portfolios of securities (grouped by cross-section) or on individual securities. Such models may also use prior price momentum to capture behavioral trends that may be correlated to future price performance, and may incorporate measures of supply versus demand.

### Model Variations
Models may be separated by sub-groups (different equity sectors, for example), may have interaction terms ($$F_{1t}$$ may appear as an individual factor in addition to the product of $$F_1$$ and $$F_2$$, i.e., $$F_{1t} \times F_{2t}$$) or may have dummy variables (for example, $$D_1$$ may represent a dummy variable for whether a company is larger than a certain size). Factor models need not be linear; quadratic terms (and higher-order terms) may be added to a linear model as well.

### Risk Management and Applications
Factor models serve dual purposes:
* Return prediction
* Risk modeling—using specific factors to explain the degree of variability in performance on an absolute basis or relative to the factors being modeled

Improved risk management techniques, designed to weight strategies according to different markets conditions and changes in liquidity and sentiment, are gaining more attention, particularly against a macroeconomic environment where policy tools (and their associated impact on the markets) are unprecedented.

### Risks and Limitations
Several risks exist when using quantitative models to predict asset returns:

1. Historical relationships between factors and returns may not continue
2. Non-linear relationships among variables may go undetected
3. Unprecedented events are likely not captured in historical data
4. Traditional approaches can fail to adapt to changing market conditions

This was demonstrated in 2008, when many Quant Hedge Funds had similar positions in similar assets due to using similar sets of factors. When those positions started losing value and funds were forced to reduce or eliminate those positions, the losses increased, triggering further selling in a negative feedback loop.

## Quantitative Trading Strategies

### Types of Quantitative Hedge Fund Trading Strategies
Quant Hedge Funds come in all shapes and sizes—from small firms with employees numbering in their teens, to international funds with a presence on three continents. A larger asset base does not necessarily correlate with a larger number of employees; instead, a Hedge Fund's staff is likely to be a function of the number of strategies it employs. 

Quant Hedge Funds may focus on equities, fixed income or other asset classes, although rarely would a Quant Hedge Fund be involved in a long-only strategy of individual stock-picking on an unhedged basis. Many CTAs or "Commodity Trading Advisors" also would be considered Quant Hedge Funds, given their role in buying or selling futures contracts, options on futures, or retail off-exchange forex contracts (or counseling others to trade in these commodities).

The following table provides more detail about different types of investment strategies at Hedge Funds; it is important to note that both Quantitative and non-Quantitative versions of nearly all of these Hedge Fund investment styles can be built:

| Style | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| Global Macro | Focus on macroeconomic environment, often concentrates on currencies or major interest-rates moves. |
| Emerging Markets | Invests in the debt or equity (and less frequently, FX) of emerging markets. Markets are typically characterized by their relative lack of transparency and liquidity, in addition to an inability to find viable derivatives contracts for hedging. |
| Equity Market Neutral | Trades pairs of shares – buying one and selling another – and therefore is typically neutral to market direction (i.e., employs a beta of zero). Also called *statistical arbitrage*. May also involve trading single stocks versus an index or an Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF) against an index. |
| Convertible Arbitrage | Targets pricing anomalies between convertible bonds and the underlying shares and/or options on shares. |
| Fixed Income Arbitrage | Exploits anomalies between related bonds, often with high leverage. |
| Event-Driven | Trades based on anticipated corporate events, such as anticipated merger or take-over activity or bankruptcy filing. Also called *risk arbitrage*. |

#### **1. Global Macro**
##### **Description**
Global macro strategies analyze macroeconomic indicators, including GDP growth, inflation rates, central bank policy, interest rates, and geopolitical events. They typically trade in major asset classes like FX, equities, commodities, and bonds.

**Overview:**  
- Focuses on macroeconomic trends using **interest rates, FX, commodities, and bond yields**.  
- Involves taking directional bets based on **inflation trends, GDP growth, or central bank policies**.  
- Uses **statistical models** to forecast major market movements.

**Use-Case:**  
- Hedge funds use **economic models** to exploit interest rate differentials across countries.  
- Example: Betting on **US interest rate hikes** while shorting **Japanese Yen**.  

**Sharpe Ratio & TCA Impact:**  
- **Sharpe Ratio:** Improves if macro factors are predicted correctly.  
- **TCA Considerations:** Requires **low execution latency** due to **high leverage & large orders**.

##### **Mathematical Foundation**
- **Interest Rate Parity (IRP)**:  

$$
F = S \times \frac{(1 + i_d)}{(1 + i_f)}
$$

  where:  
  - $$F$$ = Forward exchange rate  
  - $$S$$ = Spot exchange rate  
  - $$i_d$$ = Domestic interest rate  
  - $$i_f$$ = Foreign interest rate  

- **Purchasing Power Parity (PPP)**:  

$$
S = \frac{P_d}{P_f}
$$

  where:  
  - $$P_d$$ = Domestic price level  
  - $$P_f$$ = Foreign price level  

- **Taylor Rule (Central Bank Policy)**:  

![Taylor Rule](Taylor_Rule_Formula.png)

  where:  
  - $$r$$ = Target interest rate - $$r^*$$ = Neutral interest rate  
  - $$\pi$$ = Inflation rate  
  - $$\pi^*$$ = Target inflation rate  
  - $$y$$ = Actual GDP  
  - $$y^*$$ = Potential GDP  

##### **Python Implementation**
```python
import yfinance as yf
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

# Fetch interest rate differential
us_rates = 5.25  # Example: Fed funds rate
euro_rates = 4.0  # Example: ECB rate

# Interest Rate Parity (IRP)
def forward_rate(spot, domestic_rate, foreign_rate):
    return spot * ((1 + domestic_rate) / (1 + foreign_rate))

spot_fx = 1.10  # EUR/USD
forward_fx = forward_rate(spot_fx, us_rates / 100, euro_rates / 100)
print(f"Estimated Forward Rate: {forward_fx}")
```

##### **C++17 Implementation**
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <cmath>

double forward_rate(double spot, double domestic_rate, double foreign_rate) {
    return spot * ((1 + domestic_rate) / (1 + foreign_rate));
}

int main() {
    double spot_fx = 1.10;
    double us_rates = 0.0525;
    double euro_rates = 0.04;

    double forward_fx = forward_rate(spot_fx, us_rates, euro_rates);
    std::cout << "Estimated Forward Rate: " << forward_fx << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

#### **2. Emerging Markets**
##### **Description**
This strategy focuses on trading securities in developing economies, which have higher growth potential but lower transparency and liquidity.

**Overview:**  
- Invests in **debt, equity, and FX** in emerging markets (**Brazil, India, China, etc.**).  
- High returns, but **low liquidity and regulatory risks**.  

**Use-Case:**  
- Exploiting **corporate bond mispricing** in emerging markets.  
- Example: Buying **high-yield Brazilian corporate bonds** when global risk appetite is strong.  

##### **Mathematical Foundation**
- **Sovereign Credit Spreads**:  

$$
CDS = \frac{(1 - R) \times PD}{1 - PD}
$$

  where:  
  - $$R$$ = Recovery rate  
  - $$PD$$ = Probability of Default  

- **Liquidity Premium**: Emerging market assets often carry an additional premium due to lower liquidity.  

##### **Python Implementation**
```python
def credit_spread(pd, recovery_rate):
    return ((1 - recovery_rate) * pd) / (1 - pd)

pd = 0.05  # 5% probability of default
recovery_rate = 0.40  # 40% recovery rate
spread = credit_spread(pd, recovery_rate)
print(f"Credit Spread: {spread:.2f}%")
```

##### **C++17 Implementation**
```cpp
#include <iostream>

double credit_spread(double pd, double recovery_rate) {
    return ((1 - recovery_rate) * pd) / (1 - pd);
}

int main() {
    double pd = 0.05;  // 5% probability of default
    double recovery_rate = 0.40;  // 40% recovery rate

    double spread = credit_spread(pd, recovery_rate);
    std::cout << "Credit Spread: " << spread * 100 << "%" << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

#### **3. Equity Market Neutral - Z-score Calculation**
##### **Description**
This strategy buys an undervalued stock and shorts an overvalued stock to hedge against market moves. It relies on **mean reversion** and **pair trading**.

**Overview:**  
- Uses **pair trading** to go long on an undervalued stock and short an overvalued stock.  
- **Zero beta exposure** to the market, reducing systematic risk.  

**Use-Case:**  
- High-frequency trading firms like BAM use this to **arbitrage price inefficiencies**.  

**Sharpe Ratio & TCA Impact:**  
- **Sharpe Ratio:** High due to **market neutrality** and small, frequent trades.  
- **TCA Considerations:** **Low latency execution required**, needs **co-location & direct exchange access**.  

##### **Mathematical Foundation**
- **Z-score of Price Ratio**:  

$$
Z = \frac{R - \mu}{\sigma}
$$

  where:  
  - $$R$$ = Current price ratio  
  - $$\mu$$ = Mean of historical price ratio  
  - $$\sigma$$ = Standard deviation of historical price ratio  

##### **Python Implementation**
```python
import numpy as np

def z_score(series):
    return (series[-1] - np.mean(series)) / np.std(series)

price_ratios = [1.02, 1.05, 1.03, 1.07, 1.01]
z = z_score(price_ratios)
print(f"Z-score: {z:.2f}")
```

##### **C++17 Implementation**
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <numeric>
#include <cmath>

double mean(const std::vector<double>& data) {
    return std::accumulate(data.begin(), data.end(), 0.0) / data.size();
}

double standard_deviation(const std::vector<double>& data, double mean_val) {
    double sum = 0.0;
    for (double val : data) {
        sum += (val - mean_val) * (val - mean_val);
    }
    return std::sqrt(sum / data.size());
}

double z_score(const std::vector<double>& series) {
    double mu = mean(series);
    double sigma = standard_deviation(series, mu);
    return (series.back() - mu) / sigma;
}

int main() {
    std::vector<double> price_ratios = {1.02, 1.05, 1.03, 1.07, 1.01};
    double z = z_score(price_ratios);
    std::cout << "Z-score: " << z << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

#### **4. Convertible Arbitrage - Convertible Bond Pricing**
##### **Description**
Convertible arbitrage involves trading **convertible bonds** vs. the underlying equity. It benefits from **volatility arbitrage**.

**Overview:**  
- Exploits pricing differences between **convertible bonds, stocks, and options**.  
- Hedge funds **buy underpriced convertible bonds** and **short the underlying stock**.  

**Use-Case:**  
- Used by quant hedge funds to hedge **credit risk vs. equity risk**.  
- Example: Buying **Tesla convertible bonds** and shorting **TSLA stock**.  

**Sharpe Ratio & TCA Impact:**  
- **Sharpe Ratio:** High if **hedging is optimal**.  
- **TCA Considerations:** Execution **cost-sensitive due to bid-ask spreads**.  

##### **Mathematical Foundation**
- **Convertible Bond Pricing (Black-Scholes-like Model)**  

$$
P = C + B
$$

  where:  
  - $$P$$ = Convertible bond price  
  - $$C$$ = Value of conversion option  
  - $$B$$ = Value of bond component  

##### **Python Implementation**
```python
def convertible_bond_price(conversion_option: float, bond_value: float) -> float:
    return conversion_option + bond_value

if __name__ == "__main__":
    conversion_option = 20.0
    bond_value = 80.0

    price = convertible_bond_price(conversion_option, bond_value)
    print(f"Convertible Bond Price: {price}")
```

##### **C++17 Implementation**
```cpp
#include <iostream>

double convertible_bond_price(double conversion_option, double bond_value) {
    return conversion_option + bond_value;
}

int main() {
    double conversion_option = 20.0;
    double bond_value = 80.0;

    double price = convertible_bond_price(conversion_option, bond_value);
    std::cout << "Convertible Bond Price: " << price << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

#### **5. Fixed Income Arbitrage - Yield Curve (Nelson-Siegel)**
##### **Description**
Fixed-income arbitrage exploits mispricing between bonds, such as **yield curve arbitrage**.

**Overview:**  
- Exploits bond mispricing using **yield curve models (Nelson-Siegel)**.  
- Uses leverage to amplify small arbitrage opportunities.  

**Use-Case:**  
- Hedge funds **arbitrage mispriced bond futures vs. cash bonds**.  
- Example: **Long US Treasuries, short German Bunds**.  

**Sharpe Ratio & TCA Impact:**  
- **Sharpe Ratio:** High if done with proper **liquidity management**.  
- **TCA Considerations:** Requires **smart execution algorithms**.  

##### **Mathematical Foundation**
- **Yield Curve Model** (Nelson-Siegel)  

$$
y(t) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \frac{1 - e^{-\lambda t}}{\lambda t} + \beta_2 \left( \frac{1 - e^{-\lambda t}}{\lambda t} - e^{-\lambda t} \right)
$$

##### **Python Implementation**
```python
import numpy as np

def nelson_siegel(t, beta0, beta1, beta2, lambda_):
    return beta0 + beta1 * ((1 - np.exp(-lambda_ * t)) / (lambda_ * t)) + \
           beta2 * (((1 - np.exp(-lambda_ * t)) / (lambda_ * t)) - np.exp(-lambda_ * t))

y = nelson_siegel(5, 0.03, -0.02, 0.01, 0.5)
print(f"Yield at 5Y: {y:.4f}")
```

##### **C++17 Implementation**
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <cmath>

double nelson_siegel(double t, double beta0, double beta1, double beta2, double lambda) {
    return beta0 + beta1 * ((1 - std::exp(-lambda * t)) / (lambda * t)) + 
           beta2 * (((1 - std::exp(-lambda * t)) / (lambda * t)) - std::exp(-lambda * t));
}

#### **6. Event-Driven (Merger Arbitrage)**
##### **Description**
Trades based on **M&A deals**, buying the target company and shorting the acquiring company.

**Overview:**  
- Arbitrages price discrepancies during **mergers & acquisitions**.  

**Use-Case:**  
- Used in M&A deals, like **shorting Twitter pre-Elon Musk acquisition**.  

**Sharpe Ratio & TCA Impact:**  
- **Sharpe Ratio:** High for correctly predicted deals.  
- **TCA Considerations:** Execution **timing is critical**.  

##### **Mathematical Foundation**
- **Merger Arbitrage Spread**:  

$$
Spread = \frac{P_{target} - P_{acquirer}}{P_{target}}
$$

##### **Python Implementation**
```python
def merger_arbitrage(target_price, acquirer_price):
    return (target_price - acquirer_price) / target_price

spread = merger_arbitrage(50, 48)
print(f"Merger Arbitrage Spread: {spread:.2%}")
```

##### **C++17 Implementation**
```cpp
#include <iostream>

double merger_arbitrage(double target_price, double acquirer_price) {
    return (target_price - acquirer_price) / target_price;
}

int main() {
    double target_price = 50.0;
    double acquirer_price = 48.0;

    double spread = merger_arbitrage(target_price, acquirer_price);
    std::cout << "Merger Arbitrage Spread: " << spread * 100 << "%" << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

### Relative Value Trading vs. Directional Trading

Most Quantitative Hedge Fund trading/investment approaches fall into one of two categories: those that use Relative Value strategies, and those whose strategies would be characterized as Directional. Both strategies heavily utilize computer models and statistical software.

Relative Value strategies attempt to capitalize on predictable pricing relationships (often "mean-reverting" relationships) between multiple assets (for example, the relationship between short-dated US Treasury Bill yields vs. long-dated US Treasury Bond yields, or the relationship in the implied volatility in two different option contracts). 

Directional strategies, meanwhile, typically build on trend-following or other pattern-based paths suggestive of upward or downward momentum for a security or set of securities (for example, betting that long-dated US Treasury Bond yields will increase or that implied volatility will decline).

### Relative Value Strategies

Common examples of Relative Value strategies include placing relative bets (i.e., buying one asset and selling another) on assets whose prices are closely linked:

* Government securities of two different countries
* Government securities of two different lengths to maturity
* Corporate vs. mortgage bond securities
* The differential in implied volatility between two derivatives
* Equity prices vs. bond prices for a corporate bond issuer
* Corporate bond yield spreads vs. Credit Default Swap (CDS) spreads

There are three very important and commonly used Relative Value strategies:

1. **Statistical Arbitrage**: Trading a mean-reverting trend of the values of similar baskets of assets based on historical trading relationships. One common form of Statistical Arbitrage, or "Stat Arb," trading, is known as Equity Market Neutral trading. In this strategy, two baskets of equities are chosen (one "long" basket and one "short" basket), with the goal that the relative weights of the two baskets leave the fund with zero net exposure to various risk factors (industry, geography, sector, etc.) Stat Arb also could involve the trading of an index against a similarly matched ETF, or an index versus a single company's stock.

2. **Convertible Arbitrage**: Purchasing of convertible bonds issued by a company and simultaneously selling the same company's common stock, with the idea being that should the stock of a given company decline, the profit from the short position will more than offset any loss on the convertible bond position, given the convertible bond's value as a fixed-income instrument. Similarly, in any upward price move of the common stock, the fund can profit from the conversion of its convertible bonds into stock, selling that stock at market value by an amount that exceeds any losses on its short position.

3. **Fixed Income Arbitrage**: Trading fixed income securities in developed bond markets to exploit perceived relative interest rate anomalies. Fixed Income Arbitrage positions can use government bonds, interest rate swaps, and interest rate futures. One popular example of this style of trading in fixed income arbitrage is the "basis trade," in which one sells (buys) Treasury futures, and buys (sells) a corresponding amount of the potential deliverable bond. Here, one is taking a view on the difference between the spot price of a bond and the adjusted future's contract price (futures price × conversion factor) and trading the pairs of assets accordingly.

**Mathematical Background**
Relative Value strategies rely on **statistical arbitrage**, assuming asset price relationships **revert to a mean** over time. This often involves:
- **Cointegration (Johansen Test, Engle-Granger Test)**
- **Pairs Trading (Mean Reversion Model)**
- **Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for Bond Arbitrage**
- **Fixed Income Arbitrage (Yield Curve & Basis Trades)**

**Pairs Trading (Mean Reversion Model)**
Let’s assume we have two asset prices $$X_t$$ and $$Y_t$$. If they are **cointegrated**, then a linear combination exists:

$$
Z_t = Y_t - \beta X_t
$$

where $$Z_t$$ follows **Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process**:

$$
dZ_t = \theta (\mu - Z_t)dt + \sigma dW_t
$$

where:
- $$\theta$$ = speed of mean reversion  
- $$\mu$$ = long-term mean  
- $$\sigma$$ = volatility  
- $$dW_t$$ = Wiener process  

**Trading Rule**: Go long when $$Z_t$$ is below $$\mu - k\sigma$$, short when $$Z_t$$ is above $$\mu + k\sigma$$.

#### Statistical Arbitrage
1. High-Level Summary:
- Statistical arbitrage is a mathematical approach to trading that seeks to profit from relative price differences between related securities
- It relies on the assumption that price relationships between similar securities tend to remain stable over time
- When deviations occur, traders take positions expecting prices to revert to their historical relationship

2. Use Cases:
- Pairs Trading: Trading two highly correlated stocks (e.g., Coca-Cola vs. Pepsi)
- ETF vs. Underlying: Arbitraging price differences between ETFs and their constituent stocks
- Index Arbitrage: Trading futures contracts against the underlying index components
- Cross-Border Arbitrage: Same security listed on different exchanges

3. Implementation Metrics from Top Funds:
- Typical Sharpe Ratios: 2.0-3.5 (pre-fees) for well-executed strategies
- Transaction Costs: 2-5 bps per trade for liquid US equities
- Holding Periods: Usually ranges from intraday to 5 days
- Capacity: $1-5 billion for liquid market neutral strategies

4. Mathematical Background:
- Mean Reversion Tests: Augmented Dickey-Fuller test for stationarity
- Cointegration Analysis: Engle-Granger or Johansen tests
- Position Sizing: Kelly Criterion or risk parity approaches
- Signal Generation: Z-score based on historical spread distribution

#### Statistical Arbitrage - Mathematical Background
##### 1. Mean Reversion Tests

###### 1.1 Augmented Dickey-Fuller Test
The ADF test examines the null hypothesis that a time series $$y_t$$ follows a unit root process:

$$
\Delta y_t = \alpha + \beta t + \gamma y_{t-1} + \sum_{i=1}^{p} \delta_i \Delta y_{t-i} + \epsilon_t
$$

where:
- $$\Delta y_t$$ is the first difference of the series
- $$\alpha$$ is the drift term
- $$\beta t$$ is the linear time trend
- $$\gamma$$ is the coefficient testing for a unit root
- $$\delta_i$$ are the lagged difference coefficients
- $$\epsilon_t$$ is white noise

The test statistic is:

$$
\text{ADF} = \frac{\hat{\gamma}}{\text{SE}(\hat{\gamma})}
$$

Reject the null hypothesis of a unit root if the test statistic is less than the critical value.

###### 1.2 Cointegration Analysis
Two series $$X_t$$ and $$Y_t$$ are cointegrated if there exists a linear combination that is stationary:

$$
Z_t = Y_t - \beta X_t
$$

The Engle-Granger two-step method:
1. Estimate $$\beta$$ using OLS regression
2. Test residuals for stationarity using ADF

##### 2. Position Sizing

###### 2.1 Kelly Criterion
The optimal fraction of capital to allocate:

$$
f^* = \frac{p\cdot b - q}{b}
$$

where:
- $$p$$ is the probability of winning
- $$q = 1-p$$ is the probability of losing
- $$b$$ is the odds received on the bet

###### 2.2 Risk Parity
For a portfolio of n assets, risk parity weights solve:

$$
w_i \cdot (\Sigma w)_i = w_j \cdot (\Sigma w)_j \quad \forall i,j
$$

where:
- $$w_i$$ is the weight of asset i
- $$\Sigma$$ is the covariance matrix
- $$(\Sigma w)_i$$ is the i-th element of $$\Sigma w$$

##### 3. Signal Generation

###### 3.1 Z-Score Calculation
For a spread series $$S_t$$:

$$
Z_t = \frac{S_t - \mu_t}{\sigma_t}
$$

where:
- $$\mu_t$$ is the rolling mean
- $$\sigma_t$$ is the rolling standard deviation

Trading signals:
- Long spread when $$Z_t < -k$$
- Short spread when $$Z_t > k$$
where $$k$$ is the threshold (typically 2)

#### Convertible Arbitrage - Mathematical Background
##### 1. Option Component Valuation

###### 1.1 Black-Scholes Model
The value of a call option:

$$
C = Se^{-qt}N(d_1) - Ke^{-rt}N(d_2)
$$

where:
- $$d_1 = \frac{\ln(S/K) + (r-q+\sigma^2/2)t}{\sigma\sqrt{t}}$$
- $$d_2 = d_1 - \sigma\sqrt{t}$$

and:
- $$S$$ is the stock price
- $$$K$$ is the strike price
- $$r$$ is the risk-free rate
- $$q$$ is the dividend yield
- $$\sigma$$ is the volatility
- $$t$$ is time to expiration
- $$N(\cdot)$$ is the standard normal CDF

###### 1.2 Convertible Bond Price
The theoretical price is:

$$
V_{CB} = V_{Bond} + CR \cdot V_{Option}
$$

where:
- $$V_{Bond}$$ is the straight bond value
- $$CR$$ is the conversion ratio
- $$V_{Option}$$ is the call option value

##### 2. Greeks Calculation

###### 2.1 Delta
First-order price sensitivity to underlying:

$$
\Delta = CR \cdot N(d_1)e^{-qt}
$$

###### 2.2 Gamma
Second-order price sensitivity:

$$
\Gamma = CR \cdot \frac{N'(d_1)}{S\sigma\sqrt{t}}e^{-qt}
$$

###### 2.3 Vega
Sensitivity to volatility:

$$

#### Fixed Income Arbitrage - Mathematical Background
##### 1. Yield Curve Modeling

###### 1.1 Nelson-Siegel Model
The yield curve is modeled as:

$$
y(t) = \beta_0 + \beta_1\left(\frac{1-e^{-t/\tau}}{t/\tau}\right) + \beta_2\left(\frac{1-e^{-t/\tau}}{t/\tau} - e^{-t/\tau}\right)
$$

where:
- $$\beta_0$$ is the long-term level
- $$\beta_1$$ is the slope
- $$\beta_2$$ is the curvature
- $$\tau$$ is the decay factor

###### 1.2 Forward Rates
The instantaneous forward rate:

$$
f(t) = -\frac{\partial}{\partial T}\ln P(t,T)
$$

where $$P(t,T)$$ is the zero-coupon bond price.

##### 2. Duration and Convexity

###### 2.1 Modified Duration
Price sensitivity to yield changes:

$$
D_{mod} = -\frac{1}{P}\frac{\partial P}{\partial y}
$$

###### 2.2 Convexity
Second-order price sensitivity:

$$
C = \frac{1}{P}\frac{\partial^2 P}{\partial y^2}
$$

##### 3. Butterfly Trading

###### 3.1 Duration-Neutral Weights
For a butterfly trade:

$$
w_1D_1 + w_2D_2 + w_3D_3 = 0
$$

$$
w_1 + w_2 + w_3 = 0
$$

where:
- $$w_i$$ are the weights
- $$D_i$$ are the durations

##### 4. Risk-Adjusted Returns

###### 4.1 Information Ratio
$$
IR = \frac{R_p - R_b}{\sigma_{p-b}}
$$

where:
- $$R_p$$ is portfolio return
- $$R_b$$ is benchmark return
- $$\sigma_{p-b}$$ is tracking error

###### 4.2 Value at Risk
For a normally distributed P&L:

$$
VaR_{\alpha} = -\mu + \sigma\Phi^{-1}(\alpha)
$$

where:
- $$\mu$$ is expected P&L
- $$\sigma$$ is P&L volatility
- $$\Phi^{-1}(\alpha)$$ is the inverse normal CDF at confidence level $$\alpha$$

### Directional Strategies
Directional trading strategies typically build on trend-following or other pattern-based paths suggestive of upward or downward momentum for a security's price. Directional trading will often incorporate some aspect of Technical Analysis or "charting." This involves predicting the direction of prices through the study of past price and volume market data. The "direction" being traded can be that of an asset itself (momentum in equity prices, for example, or the euro/U.S. dollar exchange rate) or a factor that directly affects the asset price itself (for example, implied volatility for options or interest rates for government bonds).

Technical trading may also comprise the use of moving averages, bands around the historical standard deviation of prices, support and resistance levels, and rates of change. Typically, technical indicators would not constitute the sole basis for a Quantitative Hedge Fund's investment strategy; Quant Hedge Funds employ many additional factors over and above historical price and volume information. In other words, Quantitative Hedge Funds that employ Directional trading strategies generally have overall quantitative strategies that are much more sophisticated than general Technical Analysis.

### **Directional Trading Strategies (Momentum-Based)**
#### **Mathematical Background**
Directional strategies use **time-series momentum** (e.g., Moving Averages) or **cross-sectional momentum** (ranking assets).

**Trend Following Rule (Moving Average Crossover)**:

![Moving_Average_Crossover](./Moving_Average_Crossover.png)

#### **Python Implementation (Momentum Strategy)**
```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

prices = pd.Series(np.cumsum(np.random.normal(0, 1, 1000)) + 100)
sma_fast = prices.rolling(10).mean()
sma_slow = prices.rolling(50).mean()

signal = np.where(sma_fast > sma_slow, 1, -1)
```

#### **C++ Implementation (Moving Average Crossover)**
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <numeric>

std::vector<double> moving_average(const std::vector<double>& prices, int period) {
    std::vector<double> ma(prices.size());
    for (size_t i = period; i < prices.size(); ++i) {
        ma[i] = std::accumulate(prices.begin() + i - period, prices.begin() + i, 0.0) / period;
    }
    return ma;
}

int main() {
    std::vector<double> prices(1000, 100.0);
    for (size_t i = 1; i < prices.size(); i++)
        prices[i] += ((rand() % 200 - 100) / 100.0);

    auto fast_ma = moving_average(prices, 10);
    auto slow_ma = moving_average(prices, 50);

    std::vector<int> signal(prices.size(), 0);
    for (size_t i = 50; i < prices.size(); i++)
        signal[i] = (fast_ma[i] > slow_ma[i]) ? 1 : -1;

    std::cout << "Final Signal: " << signal.back() << "\n";
    return 0;
}
```

### **Sharpe Ratio & TCA Analysis**
The **Sharpe Ratio** is defined as:

$$
SR = \frac{E[R_t - R_f]}{\sigma_R}
$$

where $$R_t$$ = strategy returns, $$R_f$$ = risk-free rate, $$\sigma_R$$ = volatility.

- **Relative Value Strategies**:  
  - **Sharpe Ratio**: $$1.5 - 4.0$$ (higher due to stable mean reversion)  
  - **TCA**: Moderate, but execution speed is crucial.

- **Directional Strategies**:  
  - **Sharpe Ratio**: $$0.8 - 2.5$$ (lower due to market volatility)  
  - **TCA**: Higher costs due to stop-loss & trend breakouts.

### **Improving Sharpe Ratio & Reducing TCA**
- **Better Signal Processing (Machine Learning / Bayesian Filtering)**
- **Cost-aware execution algorithms (VWAP, TWAP, Iceberg orders)**
- **Reducing Market Impact using Dark Pools / Internal Liquidity**

### Other Quantitative Strategies

Other quantitative trading approaches that are not easily categorized as either Relative Value strategies or Directional strategies include:

* **High-Frequency Trading**: Where traders attempt to take advantage of pricing discrepancies among multiple platforms with many trades throughout the day

* **Managed Volatility Strategies**: Use futures and forward contracts to focus on generating low, but stable, LIBOR-plus absolute returns, increasing or decreasing the number of contracts dynamically as the underlying volatilities of the stock, bond and other markets shift. Managed Volatility Strategies have gained in popularity in recent years due to the recent instability of both stock and bond markets.

#### **3.1 High-Frequency Trading (HFT)**
HFT strategies exploit **price inefficiencies** across exchanges and asset classes.
##### **Key HFT Strategies:**
- **Market Making:** Constantly quoting buy/sell prices to capture bid-ask spread.
- **Statistical Arbitrage:** Taking advantage of pricing discrepancies across multiple exchanges.
- **Latency Arbitrage:** Using **co-location** and **ultra-low latency execution** to front-run order books.

##### **Mathematical Model: Market Making Strategy**
Market makers set bid $$P_b$$ and ask $$P_a$$ prices based on:

$$
P_b = P_m - \frac{q \cdot \gamma \sigma^2}{2k}, \quad P_a = P_m + \frac{q \cdot \gamma \sigma^2}{2k}
$$

where:
- $$P_m$$ = mid-price of the asset
- $$q$$ = inventory held by the market maker
- $$\sigma$$ = asset price volatility
- $$\gamma$$ = risk aversion coefficient
- $$k$$ = order arrival rate

**Execution: HFT uses event-driven programming in C++ with Boost.Asio for low-latency networking.**

##### **HFT Implementation:**
This implementation uses an **event-driven architecture** where a market-making bot continuously updates bid/ask prices based on market conditions.

##### **Python Implementation**
```python
import numpy as np
import time

class MarketMaker:
    def __init__(self, mid_price, sigma, gamma, k):
        self.mid_price = mid_price
        self.sigma = sigma
        self.gamma = gamma
        self.k = k

    def calculate_spreads(self, inventory):
        spread = (inventory * self.gamma * self.sigma**2) / (2 * self.k)
        bid_price = self.mid_price - spread
        ask_price = self.mid_price + spread
        return bid_price, ask_price

    def run(self):
        inventory = 0  # Initialize inventory
        while True:
            bid, ask = self.calculate_spreads(inventory)
            print(f"Bid: {bid:.2f}, Ask: {ask:.2f}")
            inventory += np.random.choice([-1, 1])  # Simulate market fills
            time.sleep(0.5)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    bot = MarketMaker(mid_price=100, sigma=0.5, gamma=0.1, k=1.5)
    bot.run()
```
**Explanation:**
- Uses **inventory-based pricing** to update bid/ask spreads dynamically.
- The **event loop** simulates order fills randomly.

##### **C++17 Implementation (Boost.Asio)**
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <cmath>
#include <thread>
#include <random>

class MarketMaker {
private:
    double mid_price, sigma, gamma, k;
    int inventory;
    std::mt19937 rng;
    std::uniform_int_distribution<int> dist;

public:
    MarketMaker(double mid, double s, double g, double k_val)
        : mid_price(mid), sigma(s), gamma(g), k(k_val), inventory(0), rng(std::random_device{}()), dist(-1, 1) {}

    std::pair<double, double> calculate_spreads() {
        double spread = (inventory * gamma * sigma * sigma) / (2 * k);
        double bid_price = mid_price - spread;
        double ask_price = mid_price + spread;
        return {bid_price, ask_price};
    }

    void run() {
        while (true) {
            auto [bid, ask] = calculate_spreads();
            std::cout << "Bid: " << bid << ", Ask: " << ask << std::endl;
            inventory += dist(rng);  // Simulate trade execution
            std::this_thread::sleep_for(std::chrono::milliseconds(500));
        }
    }
};

int main() {
    MarketMaker bot(100, 0.5, 0.1, 1.5);
    bot.run();
    return 0;
}
```
**Optimized for low latency with**:
- **Boost.Asio** (if expanded to network orders).
- **std::thread** for continuous execution.
- **Random execution simulation**.

#### **3.2 Managed Volatility Strategies**
Managed Volatility funds aim for **stable, low-risk absolute returns** by dynamically adjusting leverage in response to volatility changes.

##### **Key Concepts:**
- **Dynamic Position Sizing:** Allocates capital based on market volatility $$\sigma_t$$.
- **Futures-Based Allocation:** Uses futures & forwards to rebalance exposure.
- **LIBOR-Plus Benchmark:** Targets LIBOR + premium returns.

##### **Mathematical Model: Volatility-Managed Portfolio**
The optimal portfolio weight $$w_t$$ is:

$$
w_t = \frac{\mu_t}{\lambda \sigma_t^2}
$$

where:
- $$\mu_t$$ = expected return
- $$\sigma_t$$ = rolling volatility estimate
- $$\lambda$$ = risk tolerance parameter

**Implementation: Uses time-series volatility estimation (e.g., GARCH model) and adaptive rebalancing in Python & C++.**

This strategy adjusts portfolio weight dynamically based on **volatility estimation**.

##### **Python Implementation**
```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

class ManagedVolatility:
    def __init__(self, expected_return, lambda_risk, window=30):
        self.mu = expected_return
        self.lambda_risk = lambda_risk
        self.window = window

    def compute_weight(self, returns):
        rolling_vol = returns.rolling(self.window).std()
        weight = self.mu / (self.lambda_risk * (rolling_vol ** 2))
        return weight

# Simulated Data
data = pd.Series(np.random.randn(100) * 0.02)  # Random returns
strategy = ManagedVolatility(expected_return=0.05, lambda_risk=2.0)
weights = strategy.compute_weight(data)

print(weights.tail())
```
**Key Components:**
- **Rolling volatility** estimation (30-day).
- **Dynamic weight allocation** based on risk-adjusted return.

##### **C++17 Implementation (Eigen)**
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <Eigen/Dense>
#include <vector>
#include <cmath>

class ManagedVolatility {
private:
    double mu, lambda_risk;
    int window;

public:
    ManagedVolatility(double expected_return, double risk_lambda, int win = 30)
        : mu(expected_return), lambda_risk(risk_lambda), window(win) {}

    Eigen::VectorXd compute_weight(const Eigen::VectorXd& returns) {
        Eigen::VectorXd weights(returns.size());
        for (int i = window; i < returns.size(); ++i) {
            double rolling_vol = returns.segment(i - window, window).array().square().mean();
            weights(i) = mu / (lambda_risk * rolling_vol);
        }
        return weights;
    }
};

int main() {
    Eigen::VectorXd returns = Eigen::VectorXd::Random(100) * 0.02;
    ManagedVolatility strategy(0.05, 2.0);
    Eigen::VectorXd weights = strategy.compute_weight(returns);

    std::cout << "Last 5 weights: " << weights.tail(5).transpose() << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

**Performance Enhancements:**
- Uses **Eigen** for **fast matrix calculations**.
- Efficient **rolling volatility calculation**.

##### **Summary**
| Strategy | Python3 | C++17 |
|----------|---------|--------|
| **HFT (Market Making)** | **Event loop-based bot, dynamic pricing** | **Boost.Asio for real-time execution, low latency** |
| **Managed Volatility** | **Rolling volatility estimation with NumPy/Pandas** | **Eigen-based optimized implementation** |

##### **Sharpe Ratio & TCA Analysis**
The **Sharpe Ratio** is defined as:

$$
SR = \frac{E[R_t - R_f]}{\sigma_R}
$$

where $$R_t$$ = strategy returns, $$R_f$$ = risk-free rate, $$\sigma_R$$ = volatility.

- **HFT & Managed Volatility Strategies:**  
  - **HFT Sharpe Ratio:** $$5.0+$$ (high, but requires infrastructure investment)  
  - **Managed Volatility Sharpe Ratio:** $$1.5 - 3.0$$ (moderate, with risk-adjusted returns)  
  - **TCA:** Minimal for Managed Volatility, but extreme for HFT due to colocation & network costs.

##### **Optimizing Strategies for Higher Sharpe Ratios**
- **Better Signal Processing (Machine Learning / Bayesian Filtering)**
- **Cost-aware execution algorithms (VWAP, TWAP, Iceberg orders)**
- **Reducing Market Impact using Dark Pools / Internal Liquidity**

## What advances have occurred in Hedge Fund industry?
As of August 2023, many quantitative funds have evolved beyond traditional linear factor models with fixed weighting. While linear factor models, such as the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) and multi-factor models, are still foundational in finance, many funds have begun to adopt more sophisticated approaches. Here are some key trends:

- **Dynamic Weighting:** Many quantitative funds now use dynamic weighting schemes that adjust based on market conditions, volatility, or other factors rather than relying on fixed weights.
- **Machine Learning:** Increasingly, funds are incorporating machine learning techniques to identify patterns and relationships in data that traditional models may miss. This allows for more adaptive and responsive investment strategies.
- **Alternative Data:** The use of alternative data sources (e.g., social media sentiment, satellite imagery, etc.) has become more prevalent, leading to more complex models that go beyond simple linear relationships.
- **Multi-Factor Models:** While traditional factor models still play a role, many funds are combining multiple factors (e.g., value, momentum, quality) in a more holistic approach, often using non-linear methods to capture interactions between these factors.
- **Risk Parity and Other Strategies:** Some quantitative funds are employing risk parity or other portfolio construction techniques that do not rely solely on traditional linear models.
In summary, while linear factor models remain a part of the toolkit for many quantitative funds, the industry is increasingly moving towards more advanced, flexible, and data-driven methodologies.

### Detailed Mathematical Explanation

#### 1. Dynamic Weighting
Dynamic weighting entails adjusting the weights of assets in a portfolio based on certain market conditions. The weights $$w_i$$ for asset $$i$$ can be represented mathematically as:

$$
w_i(t) = f(X(t), Y(t), Z(t))
$$

where:
- $$f$$ is a function that determines weight based on various inputs,
- $$X(t)$$ could represent market volatility,
- $$Y(t)$$ could represent momentum indicators,
- $$Z(t)$$ could represent economic indicators.

A common approach to dynamic weighting is to use optimization techniques that maximize expected returns for a given level of risk.

#### 2. Machine Learning
Incorporating machine learning requires the use of algorithms to identify patterns in historical data. For example, an algorithm $$A$$ could predict future returns based on features $$F$$:

$$
R_{pred} = A(F)
$$

where $$R_{pred}$$ is the predicted return.

Common algorithms used include:
- Regression Trees
- Neural Networks
- Support Vector Machines

#### 3. Alternative Data
The integration of alternative data can be represented as an additional feature in the model. For instance, if we denote alternative data features as $$D$$:

$$
R_{pred} = A(F, D)
$$

This allows models to capture non-linear relationships and interactions among data points.

#### 4. Multi-Factor Models
In multi-factor models, the expected return $$R$$ can be expressed as:

$$
R = \alpha + \beta_1 F_1 + \beta_2 F_2 + \ldots + \beta_n F_n + \epsilon
$$

where:
- $$\alpha$$ is the intercept,
- $$\beta$$ are the factor loadings,
- $$F_n$$ are the factors,
- $$\epsilon$$ is the error term.

#### 5. Risk Parity
Risk parity involves weighting assets based on their risk contributions rather than their expected returns. The risk contribution $$R_{C_i}$$ for asset $$i$$ can be expressed as:

$$
R_{C_i} = w_i \cdot \sigma_i \cdot \rho_i
$$

where:
- $$\sigma_i$$ is the standard deviation of asset $$i$$,
- $$\rho_i$$ is the correlation of asset $$i$$ with the overall portfolio.

### Acceptable Sharpe Ratio and TCA in Hedge Funds
**Sharpe Ratio**: A Sharpe Ratio of 1.0 is generally considered acceptable; values above 1.5 are often seen in top hedge funds. A ratio above 2.0 is exceptional.

**Transaction Cost Analysis (TCA)**: TCA should ideally show low costs relative to the expected returns. Acceptable TCA metrics depend on the fund's strategy but generally aim for a cost-to-return ratio of less than 10% for active strategies.

### Conclusion
The evolution of quantitative funds reflects a shift towards more adaptive and sophisticated strategies that leverage dynamic weighting, machine learning, alternative data, and multi-factor models. Top hedge funds typically maintain high Sharpe Ratios and manage transaction costs effectively.
