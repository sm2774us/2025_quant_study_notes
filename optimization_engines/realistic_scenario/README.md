# Realistic Scenario: Treasury Trading Optimization at Balyasny Asset Management L.P.

**Role**: Senior Quantitative Researcher  
**Context**: Balyasny Asset Management L.P. (BAM) operates a multi-strategy platform, blending systematic, quantitative, and discretionary approaches. Unlike macro-focused funds, Balyasny emphasizes data-driven, high-frequency, and relative-value strategies across equities, fixed income, and derivatives. A Senior Quantitative Researcher in their fixed-income team would develop models to exploit inefficiencies in the U.S. Treasury market while managing risk and capital efficiency.

**Scenario**:  
In 2024, the U.S. Treasury market shows dislocations due to Fed rate hikes and liquidity shifts. BAM’s fixed-income desk allocates $250 million to a treasury relative-value strategy, aiming to maximize risk-adjusted returns by taking long and short positions across the yield curve. The Senior Quantitative Researcher designs an optimization model that:
- Uses real-time yield data (5 YR, 7 YR, 10 YR, 20 YR, 30 YR).
- Minimizes funding costs (repo rates) while maximizing yield spreads.
- Incorporates transaction costs and market impact.
- Enforces risk limits (e.g., Conditional Value-at-Risk, CVaR) and leverage constraints.
- Ensures liquidity-adjusted position sizing.

**Problem**:  
Optimize a treasury portfolio to maximize net spread (yield minus funding cost) minus transaction costs, subject to CVaR, leverage, and liquidity constraints, leveraging Balyasny’s quantitative edge.

**Data**:  
- **Yields**: `[2.00, 2.13, 2.24, 2.41, 2.48]`% (2024 real yields).
- **Repo Rates**: `[1.95, 2.00, 2.05, 2.15, 2.20]`%.
- **Transaction Costs**: `[0.001, 0.0015, 0.002, 0.0025, 0.003]` (basis points scaled).
- **Durations**: `[4.5, 6.2, 9.0, 17.5, 25.0]` years.
- **Volatility**: `[0.15, 0.17, 0.19, 0.22, 0.25]`% (daily).
- **Liquidity**: `[100, 90, 80, 60, 50]` ($M tradable daily).

**Objective**:  
Maximize net spread minus costs, reflecting Balyasny’s focus on relative value and systematic trading.

# Mathematical Deep Dive: Treasury Trading Optimization at Balyasny Asset Management L.P.

This document explores the mathematics behind a treasury trading optimization problem for a Senior Quantitative Researcher at Balyasny Asset Management L.P. (BAM), a multi-strategy quant fund, as of February 19, 2025.

## Scenario Overview

Optimize a $250M treasury portfolio to maximize risk-adjusted net spread (yield minus funding cost) minus transaction costs, using 2024 real yield curve data (5 YR, 7 YR, 10 YR, 20 YR, 30 YR). The model reflects BAM’s systematic, relative-value approach in fixed income.

### Objective Function
Maximize net spread minus transaction costs:

$$S = \sum_{i=1}^{n} w_i (r_i - r_f_i) - c_i |w_i|$$

Where:
- $w_i$: Portfolio weight (positive for long, negative for short).
- $r_i$: Treasury yield (e.g., 2.00% for 5 YR).
- $r_f_i$: Repo rate (e.g., 1.95% for 5 YR).
- $c_i$: Transaction cost per unit weight (e.g., 0.001 for 5 YR).
- $|w_i|$: Absolute weight for costs on both sides.
- $n = 5$: Number of maturities.

Since we maximize, this becomes:

$$\text{Maximize: } \mathbf{w}^T (\mathbf{r} - \mathbf{r}_f) - \mathbf{c}^T |\mathbf{w}|$$

### Constraints
1. **Capital Constraint**: Total leverage limited:
   $$\sum_{i=1}^{n} |w_i| V_i \leq K$$
   Where $V_i = 50M$ (notional per unit), $K = 250M$.

2. **CVaR Constraint**: 95% Conditional Value-at-Risk (e.g., $3M):
   $$\alpha + \\frac{1}{1 - 0.95} \\mathbb{E} [(\\mathbf{w}^T \\mathbf{\\sigma} Z)^+ ] \\leq 3$$
   Approximated via sample scenarios $Z$.

3. **Liquidity Constraint**: Position size respects daily liquidity:
   $$|w_i| V_i \\leq L_i$$
   Where $L_i$ is liquidity (e.g., 100M for 5 YR).

4. **Haircut**: Minimum collateral:
   $$|w_i| \\geq h_i = 0.02$$

## Formulation
This is a **Convex Optimization Problem** (linear objective, convex constraints):

$$\text{Maximize: } \\mathbf{w}^T (\mathbf{r} - \\mathbf{r}_f) - \\mathbf{c}^T |\mathbf{w}|$$
$$\text{Subject to: }$$
$$\\mathbf{1}^T |\mathbf{w}| V \\leq 250$$
$$\\alpha + \\frac{1}{0.05} \\frac{1}{m} \\sum_{j=1}^{m} (\\mathbf{w}^T \\mathbf{\\sigma} Z_j)^+ \\leq 3$$
$$|\mathbf{w}| V \\leq \\mathbf{L}$$
$$|\mathbf{w}| \\geq 0.02$$

Vectors:
- $\mathbf{w}$: Weights.
- $\mathbf{r}$: Yields.
- $\mathbf{r}_f$: Repo rates.
- $\mathbf{c}$: Costs.
- $\mathbf{\\sigma}$: Volatilities.
- $\mathbf{L}$: Liquidity limits.

## Mathematical Insights
- **Convexity**: Linear objective with convex CVaR (piecewise linear) and linear constraints ensure a unique optimum.
- **Relative Value**: Long positions where $r_i > r_f_i$, short where $r_f_i > r_i$, adjusted for costs and risk.
- **CVaR**: More conservative than VaR, aligning with Balyasny’s risk-aware quant culture.

## Solver Approach
Balyasny might use MOSEK or Gurobi for QP/LP with CVaR approximated via scenario sampling:
- **KKT Conditions**:
  $$(\\mathbf{r} - \\mathbf{r}_f) - \\mathbf{c} \\text{sign}(\\mathbf{w}) + \\lambda \\mathbf{1} + \\boldsymbol{\\mu} \\mathbf{\\sigma} - \\boldsymbol{\\nu} = 0$$

## Practical Notes
- **High Frequency**: Real-time data feeds adjust $\\mathbf{r}$ and $\\mathbf{r}_f$.
- **Multi-Strategy**: Integrates with BAM’s broader equity and FX models.
- **Execution**: Liquidity constraints reflect BAM’s focus on tradable edges.

### Explanation of Changes for Balyasny
- **Objective Shift**: From minimizing cost to maximizing net spread, reflecting Balyasny’s relative-value focus over pure macro hedging.
- **Scale**: Reduced to $250M, fitting a multi-strategy fund’s allocation to a single fixed-income strategy.
- **Constraints**: Added liquidity and CVaR (more stringent than VaR), aligning with Balyasny’s systematic risk management.
- **Math**: Transitioned to a maximization problem with convex CVaR, still solvable as QP but approximated in the notebook for simplicity.
- **Balyasny Context**: Emphasizes data-driven execution and multi-strategy integration, typical of their quant teams.

The notebook uses CVXOPT for demonstration, though at Balyasny, a Senior Quantitative Researcher might leverage proprietary solvers or Gurobi/MOSEK with full CVaR implementation. Let me know if you’d like a specific solver or deeper practical details!
